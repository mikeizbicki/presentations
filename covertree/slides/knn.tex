They speed up nearest neighbor queries, e.g. in
 $k$-nn classification:

But neighbor queries are used in many other algorithms too:
\begin{itemize}
\item Localized support vector machines (Segata \& Blanzieri, 2010)
\item Dimensionality reduction (Lisitsyn \emph{et. al.}, 2013)
\item Reinforcement learning (Tziortziotis \emph{et. al.}, 2014)
\end{itemize}
